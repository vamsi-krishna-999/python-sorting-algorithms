Selection Sort:
================
Definition: 
************
Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly 
selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted 
portion of the list and moves it to the beginning (or end).

Procedure:
**********
It divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted sub-list, 
repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted 
sub-list and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

Important Points:
*****************
Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2).
It performs better than bubble sort but still not efficient for large datasets.

Source Code:
=============

def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
    return arr

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
    print("Original array:", arr)
    sorted_arr = selection_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
