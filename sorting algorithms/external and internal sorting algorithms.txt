internal and external

===============================


Internal and external sorting algorithms are classified based on how they 
handle the data being sorted with respect to the available memory. 
Internal sorting algorithms process the entire dataset within the main memory (RAM),

 while external sorting algorithms are designed to handle datasets that are too large to 
fit entirely in memory and require the use of external storage such as disk.
