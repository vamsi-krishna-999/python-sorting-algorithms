1. Bubble Sort:
Definition: Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Procedure: It compares each element with the one next to it and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, repeating this process until no swaps are needed.

Important Points:

Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2).
It is not efficient for large datasets but is easy to understand and implement.


Source Code with Explanation:
=============================

def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
    print("Original array:", arr)
    sorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
